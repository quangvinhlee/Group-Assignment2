	<h2> Enhancement 1:</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	Featured on the "Home" page, the animation property <strong><a href="index.html#description_container">"(animation: fade-in-out 2s ease-in-out forwards;)</a>"</strong>has been allocated for the image that provides a fade-in-out effect for 2 seconds with an ease in-out function.
	Along with the commonly used CSS markups, the <strong>(background-size:100% auto;) and (height: 100vh;)</strong> have resulted in a good overall result aesthetically.</p>
	<br> <br>
	<h2> Enhancement 2:</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Also featured on the "Home" page, in the same section, the feature animation is applied to the paragraph and button.
	Added characteristics include <strong><a href="index.html#description_container">(opacity:0;) (transform: translateY(4rem);) and (animation:fadeinUp 1s 2.5s forwards;)</a></strong>. With these markups, the button element starts with an opacity of 0 and then moves up by 64 pixels <strong>(4rem = 64px)</strong> from the original position, upward along the Y-axis. 
	The addition of these markups really enhanced the website as it gave a wow-factor to whoever visits our page.
	
	These techniques were a great addition and pushed our knowledge further.</p>
	<h2>Enhancement 3:</h2>
	<br>
	<p>The website is designed to be responsive and adjusts its layout dynamically when resized, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes. The use of responsive design techniques such as fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries allows the website to reflow its content and adapt to various screen resolutions, providing a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones alike.</p>
